Trackingplan Omnibug
==========

## Omnibug

Ensuring the seamless performance of your MarTech tools should be a breeze, yet the reality is often quite the opposite. Many vendors fall short in providing user-friendly solutions, leaving businesses grappling with technical complexities, poor documentation, and a plethora of outdated browser extensions. Enter Omnibug â€“ your simplified quality assurance partner, designed to effortlessly streamline the process and put the power back in your hands.

For further details, see the [main project page](https://omnibug.io/).

## Trackingplan Integration Version

**Note:** This is a forked version of Omnibug with Trackingplan integration. **All credit goes to the original Omnibug Creator and Contributors**. This version is currently a playground for exploring the integration between Omnibug and Trackingplan functionality.

[Trackingplan](https://trackingplan.com/) is a data governance platform that automatically discovers, documents, and monitors your digital analytics implementations.
